This is a repository with example worlds generated from real world examples.

Here are some notes 


# Download content

Go to 
https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/

Create an account

Find the region of interest. Select a point or set of points.


Select Data Set(s):

 * Aerial Imagry -> High Resolution Orthoimagery
 * Digital Elevation -> SRTM -> SRTM 1 Arc-Second Global

Go to the Results and download all the tiles.
You can download them individually or in a bulk download.

Alternative data sources should be fine as well.

There will be a lot of data.
The 9 tiles I used for McMillan were each approximately 400MB
And the height map arc tile is ~ 25MB.


# Isolate area of interest

Once you have the region of interest use gdalwarp to extract the regions of interest.
This is the script I used for mcmillan and yosemite

Save these files into your gazebo resource path that's exported by the package.

Note that the 5000 is the resolution of the file laterally.

# Generate World

Then create a world that references them.

I pushed the pose down such that the airfield is at zero height in gazebo.
The size of the texture is the width of the content in meters.

Note that there's a scaling issue with the textures. I have ticketed it here: https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/2603/texture-scaling-on-heightmaps-does-not

It looks like a rendering of about 80% width is necessary.


Gazebo also seems to work better with square content, this might have been an artifact from before validating the above ratio.

# Development tip

If you are changing any textures on the height map.
Whether content or meta data it is all cached.
To change anything you will need to remove the cached paging content in `~/.gazebo/paging/VISUAL_ELEMENT`
